I am thinking about doing a Disney style small game or Disney elements ball rain,
using Mickey Mouseâ€™s Clubhouse picture as background, with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Theme Song as background music. 
The balls will keep falling from the top and having different colors.
Maybe try some color change for balls by function mousePressed.
